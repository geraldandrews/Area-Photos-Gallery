## Description:
This is a photo gallery project I created which consists of various photos I have taken over the years of different places I have visited. I created this photo gallery from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the layout of the gallery and JavaScript and the Magnific-Popup plug-in for the functionality of the gallery, such as displaying larger versions of each image and functionality of the previous and next buttons.
